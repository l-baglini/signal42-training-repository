# Blind Spot — notes for whoever picks this up

You lean to see. A webcam tracks head position; that one signal drives both an
off-axis projection (the screen behaves like a window, not a picture) and the
core verb (a target is hidden behind an occluder, and you must physically move to
a viewpoint that reveals it). The level geometry comes from the player's real
room.

Read SPEC.md first. It is not a summary written afterwards — it directed the
build, and it records the decisions and their reasons. PRIOR-ART.md records what
was already taken, and DEVLOG.md records what the build discovered that the spec
had wrong.

## The one line that must not be crossed

**The AI perceives. The engine judges.**

A depth model may say the chair is 80 cm away. A vision model may say it is a
chair and would make good cover. Neither may decide whether a target behind it is
reachable, fair, or dodgeable — that is geometry, computed deterministically, in
`src/engine/`.

No number the player sees comes from a model. If you find yourself about to let a
model output reach a game rule, you are about to break the thing that makes this
project worth showing.

## Layout

```
src/engine/     the solver. Imports NOTHING — not even from src/.
src/boundary/   validates and clamps untrusted scans before the engine sees them.
tests/          the invariants of SPEC §6.7 and the boundary guards.
tools/          instruments, not tests. They print measurements.
fixtures/       hand-authored rooms and synthetic bodies. No network in any test.
```

The dependency arrow points **inward**, which is why the shared types live at
`src/engine/types.ts` rather than in a top-level `types.ts`. `tests/purity.test.ts`
fails if an engine module grows an import from outside the directory, or reaches
for `fetch`, `Date`, `Math.random`, `performance`, `localStorage`, `window`,
`document`, `process`, `globalThis` or `navigator`.

Determinism is allowed to be random — `mulberry32` in `level.ts` is seeded, and
`Math.random` is not the same thing.

## Commands

```
npm test        the invariants and the guards. No network, no clock, no RNG.
npm run probe   what the solver thinks of each fixture room, per envelope.
npm run sweep   which candidate positions are fair. Use this to author fixtures.
npm run typecheck
```

`npm run sweep` exists because authoring a fixture by hand got it wrong the first
time: two occluders together wall off a side in a way the arithmetic for each one
separately does not show. Measure, do not calculate.

## Units

Centimetres and seconds, everywhere, with no exceptions. The screen plane is
`z = 0`, `x` right, `y` up; the player sits at `z > 0`, the scene at `z < 0`.
There are no pixels below the renderer. Fields carry their unit in the name
(`leanCm`, `windowCm`) because an earlier draft did not and it was ambiguous.

## Things that will bite you

- **A target behind an occluder that sits close to it is unreachable, always.**
  The player's leverage over the sightline is `(1 - s)` where `s` is how far along
  the eye-to-target segment the occluder plane falls. Cover close to the *window*
  is the only cover a lean can beat. See `leverage()` in `sightline.ts`.
- **Fairness thresholds are scaled to the measured body, not fixed.** The minimum
  lean is a fraction of the envelope's reach; the minimum peek window is a
  multiple of the tracker's measured jitter. Making either one a constant will
  pass the tests you expect and break the two that matter (I3's
  non-monotonicity characterisation, and I9).
- **Refusal is a first-class outcome**, not an error path. A room with nothing to
  hide behind, or a body that cannot move far, returns a typed refusal with the
  counts that explain it. Never make it return an empty level.
- **The guard tests prove containment, not correctness.** Nothing in the suite
  touches a network. They prove a wrong model answer stays harmless. Whether the
  room scan actually finds the chair is unverified and belongs to a human with a
  real room and a real key.

## State

Done: types, boundary validator, the visibility solver, five reject reasons, the
level generator with typed refusal, and invariants I1–I6, I8, I9 under test.

Not done: I7 (the dodge solver and its latency guard), I10 (the renderer and the
off-axis projection — a working prototype exists, see DEVLOG), head tracking,
the live depth scan, the semantic scan, the playable loop. SPEC §14 has the
order, and the cut order is bottom-up.
